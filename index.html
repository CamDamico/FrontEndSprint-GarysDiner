       <h1 id="storyHeader">The Big Gary's Story</h1>
       <p id="story" >
        It was 1969. While the world watched the first man walk on the moon, Big Gary celebrated the first Guest walking through his doors in St. Johnâ€™s, Newfoundland & Labrador. Needless to say, it was a giant leap for chicken. Word quickly spread and stores opened across the province. It soon became the chicken of choice. Iconic even. It was time to, pardon the pun, spread our wings. <br>

        By 1972, the secret of Big Garys tantalizing chicken was out. Two Resturants opened in St Johns From there, growth expanded west to Corner Brook, back east to Carbonear, out to Central and more recently, all the way to Nain and the Northern Parts of Labrador <br> <br>

        One thing that had always been apart of Big Garys Resturants is that the quality of the food is always exceptional! and it will continune to be! <br>
